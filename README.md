# No-code point-of-sale system targeting SMBs.

Running a small retail store or a five-star restaurant entails juggling lots of marketing, management, and administration tasks. A point-of-sale (POS) system not only gets you through the day-to-day operations but also helps propel you into the future.

POS systems have become common in the retail, wholesale, hospitality industry and beyond. The global market for POS is predicted to grow three-fold in the coming years. Once expensive and only fit for large enterprises, POS solutions today come in any shape, form, and flavor. 

# What you should know before creating a Point-of-Sale system.

1. What is a POS system

It’s a bit more than just a smart cash register. A Point-of-Sale system is a set of software and hardware for merchants to ring up sales, process returns, and tally the daily revenue. And it does a lot more – from inventory management, through financials, to warehousing. It streamlines online sales with eCommerce integrations. Most importantly, it gives valuable business insights.

Over the past decade, POS system development has evolved from bulky on-premise enterprise solutions to light-weight cloud-based systems and mobile apps. They also go way beyond retail business. So the hunch that you should build a point-of-sale system may be totally justified.

2. Where Point-of-Sale systems are usually used

Our clients often ask if we can make a POS system outside retail. It’s totally legit as modern POS solutions make a full spectrum.

A. Restaurant POS systems accept payments and streamline operations. They also track your sales and tax data. Hundreds of features make your restaurant business more efficient.

B. Bar POS software, just like the systems designed for restaurants, need to have speed functions for quick order input and quick checkout. Your customers’ happiness hinges on your promptness.

C. Retail POS systems, aka Point-of-Purchase (POP) systems, are specifically designed for the retail environment. They’re different from what a restaurant or bar business would want in terms of requirements.

D. Small business POS solutions come in many sizes and shapes. Most of the small business technology is app-based, mobile, cloud, SaaS. They are used by small retailers, restaurants, and cafes.

E. Salon and Spa POS software requires a particular set of industry-specific features like online appointment calendar, reminders, etc


# Onboarding 

Onboarding is the process of making active clients out of users of your product or service. For a company to be able to win new clients, its onboarding process must be top-notch. The same principles guide the various onboarding processes across the board but an emphasis on cryptocurrency is necessary because of its uniqueness. 

The typically complicated nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain is a turn-off for many and has slowed adoption. 
Despite the now-growing popularity of digital currencies, many still don’t know how they work because of the complex nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain.

It should be noted that when it comes to onboarding, the organization can only have guiding principles but not hard rules. That’s because each company is unique in its own way and has to adapt its strategies to its areas of strength. 

Here are some principles to help Solana easily convert traffic to clients and sales.

1. Simplicity 

The typically complicated nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain is a turn-off for many and has slowed adoption. Therefore, cryptocurrency platforms, especially a crypto platform like Solana that offers revolutionary solutions to businesses, investors, and individuals, will have a great edge if it focuses on simplicity. 

This is not just about simplicity in design but in the overall process of using the platform. New merchants should not feel overwhelmed when they come across the product else they will leave.

2. Customer is King

In planning an onboarding process, use one that is well-tailored to the merchant's needs. You may determine this by using different methods of analytics and also tracking merchant's actions on your platform.

3. Active Research and Analytics

Before you begin planning onboarding at all and, perhaps, wasting your efforts, it is good to spend a great deal of time doing some market research. Determine the kind of environment and market that ensure the growth of Solana. Learn about potential clients’ needs.

Find out things your competitors are doing wrong and make those your selling points. Even after kick-off, perform analytics to know which actions lead to the conversions and if a change is necessary. Not knowing that is one of the onboarding mistakes to avoid.

4. Show and Tell

Onboarding is not just to get merchants to start utilizing your product; it is to show them HOW in a simple and non-intrusive manner. 

Instead of too many screen-by-screen walkthroughs which are boring and arduous, short video tutorials and animations would be better to effectively explain all you want to. That way, they know how valuable your product is and what it does.

5. Educate

For the Solana platform, it is important to build your onboarding around ensuring that new merchants are quickly acquainted with the services you offer. While you will have many pro new merchants, consider that a significant chunk of your merchant base would consist of crypto newbies.

Therefore, build your onboarding around educating them about the functions of the platform. That is the more reason why the onboarding has to be kept very simple.

6. Engage with your Merchants 

Onboarding should not be a process that is just about the organization alone. The merchants too should be actively involved. While showing and telling, asking the merchants to repeat the processes explained would make for a better experience.

7. Form a Forum

Communities (including online ones) are very good. You can create a network of people who use the Solana platform and give them an avenue to discuss, seek help, and banter. Online forums give people a sense of belonging and makes them more likely to stay on as lifetime clients.

8. Personalize it

If there were a perfect onboarding process, it still wouldn’t sit well with every single merchant user of the Solana gateway. As a result of that, it is important to make the experience unique and personal for each person. That doesn’t mean creating a different onboarding process, (really?). 

It means ensuring that the process leaves some impact on the merchants. You surely know what they say about first impressions. Make sure you know your clients. 

9. Request Feedback

And yes, it still works. But as mentioned earlier, keep things simple and short. Don’t make your clients start feeling they are sitting for an examination when you give them a lengthy list of questions just to get their feedback. 

10. Selling Points

Structure your selling point about how making use of the Solana gateway would help the merchants. No one really wants to know what your product can do if its features won’t eventually be of help to them. 


# Conclusion

Many make the mistake that onboarding ends when a merchant signs up for a paid subscription of the product. That is somewhat true, but ignoring everything after that is a disaster. Even after signing up, onboarding still continues and you owe them good treatment because a Customer is king, right?
